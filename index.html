            <h1>Beginners 101</h1>
            <p>What makes a good beginner surfboard? When you’re learning how to surf, there are a few fundamental skills you’ll want to work on and develop before progressing to the next level. Most notably: where to position yourself on the board, your pop-ups, balance, paddle strength, endurance, and so on.</p>
            <p>With these basic skills in mind, a good beginner surfboard is easy to paddle, floats you well (high buoyancy), and is very stable. The basic rule of thumb here is: the bigger the better.</p>
            <p>The best beginner surfboard makes it as easy as possible to catch and ride as many waves as possible. Because the more waves you catch, the quicker you’ll progress. With a wide and stable outline and lots of buoyancy, a longboard surfboard is the best beginner surfboard around.</p>

            <h2>The Longboard</h2>
            <p>The first surfboard of the modern era was a longboard. As the name suggests, longboards are long surfboards. Longboards are typically over 9', feature a rounded or blunt nose, plenty of forward width, and wide tails.</p>

            <h2>The Shortboard</h2>
            <p>Shortboards are the most popular surfboard template in the world right now. If you visit a popular surfing beach, you'll find out that 95 percent of the surfers are riding boards between 5'5'' and 6'5''.</p>

            <h2>The Fish</h2>
            <p>Fish surfboards are similar to shortboards, but they tend to be wider from nose to tail, and smaller in length. Because of their width and low rocker, they plane better and generate a lot of speed in small-to-medium waves.</p>

            <h2>The Malibu/Funboard</h2>
            <p>A malibu, also known as funboard, is a blend between a longboard and a shortboard. They are a favorite type of board between beginners and heavier surfers, but they can also be a backup option for experienced riders who enjoy having fun in small summer conditions.</p>

            <h2>The Gun</h2>
            <p>Guns are large shortboards shaped for extreme surfing conditions. Big wave guns are quite easy to paddle and will enter fast, big wave quickly but, because they're big, they're not easy to turn. They usually feature a pintail, and the length varies from 7' to 12'.</p>

            <p>Tow-in boards are equipped with a small quad or thruster fin setup, foot straps, and are heavier than standard surfboards. Traditionally, tow boards feature pin or swallow tails, and range between 6' and 6'6''.</p>
